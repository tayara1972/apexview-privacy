# ApexView Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** December 12, 2025

ApexView (“the App”) is a personal finance app designed to help you track accounts, net worth, income and expenses, and investment holdings. Your financial data is stored on your device.

This Privacy Policy explains what information the App collects, how it is used, and the choices you have.

## Information We Collect

### 1) Data you enter into the App
ApexView stores the information you enter (such as accounts, balances, holdings, and categories) locally on your device for the purpose of providing the App’s features.

We do not require you to create an account.

### 2) Anonymous Diagnostics (optional)
ApexView can record technical diagnostics events to help identify bugs and reliability issues. These diagnostics are:

- Recorded locally on your device
- Not sent anywhere by default
- Sent to our server only if you explicitly opt in and manually tap “Send report now”

When enabled and sent, diagnostics may include:
- Which App endpoint was involved (`/quotes`, `/fx`, `/search`)
- HTTP status code (if available)
- Error type (for example: network error, decoding error, rate limiting)
- Timestamp
- App version
- iOS version
- Device model identifier
- Backend environment label (staging/production)
- A random request identifier (UUID)

## Information We Do Not Collect

ApexView’s anonymous diagnostics are designed to avoid personal and financial data. Diagnostics do not include:
- Your name, email address, phone number, or contacts
- Account names, institutions, or categories
- Account balances or net worth values
- Holdings, quantities, symbols, or transactions
- Any content from your device outside the App

## How We Use Information

We use anonymous diagnostics only to:
- Improve App stability and reliability
- Investigate and fix technical bugs
- Monitor backend service health (quotes and FX providers)

We do not use diagnostics for advertising, profiling, or marketing.

## Sharing of Information

We do not sell your data.

If you choose to send anonymous diagnostics, those diagnostics are transmitted to our server and may be processed for troubleshooting and improving the App. We do not share diagnostics with third parties except as needed to operate the App and comply with law.

## Third-Party Services

ApexView retrieves market data and currency conversion rates through our backend services, which in turn may rely on third-party market data providers. Requests are used to provide quotes, FX rates, and symbol search.

These providers may process IP addresses or basic request metadata as part of normal internet operations. ApexView does not send your personal or financial data to those providers.

## Data Retention

- On-device diagnostics: stored locally and can be cleared at any time in Settings.
- Uploaded diagnostics (if you manually send): retained only as long as needed to troubleshoot and improve the App, then deleted or anonymized.

## Your Choices and Controls

You can control diagnostics at any time in Settings:
- Turn “Share anonymous diagnostics” on or off
- Tap “Send report now” to manually submit diagnostics (only if opted in)
- Tap “Clear local diagnostics” to delete local diagnostics

## Security

We take reasonable measures to protect information transmitted to our server. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

## Children’s Privacy

ApexView is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update the effective date above.
